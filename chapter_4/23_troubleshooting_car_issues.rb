# Gather Info:
    # An expert system is a type of artificial intelligence program that uses a knowledge base and a set of rules to perform a task that a human expert might do. Many websites are available that will help you self-diagnose a medical issue by answering a series of questions. And many hardware and software companies offer online troubleshooting tools to help people solve simple technical issues before calling a human.

# Problem Statement:
    # Create a program that walks the user through troubleshooting issues with a car. Use the following decision tree to build the system:

# Inputs (nouns):
    # issues with a car

# processes (verbs):
    # walks
    # troubleshooting

# Outputs (nouns):
    # solution

# TDD
    # Input:
        # Is the car silent when you turn the key? y
        # Are the battery terminals corroded? n

    # Expected result:
        # The battery cables may be damaged.
        # Replace cables and try again.

    # Actual result:

# Pseudocode:
# Constraints:
    # Ask only questions that are relevant to the situation and to the previous answers. Donâ€™t ask for all inputs at once.

# Challenges:
    # Investigate rules engines and inference engines. These are powerful ways to solve complex problems that are based on rules and facts. Identify a rules engine for your programming language and use it to solve this problem.
